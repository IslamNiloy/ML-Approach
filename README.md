ML-Approach: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (medical_insurance_cost_prediction_cse498r.ipynb) that explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict medical insurance costs.

Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Python (version 3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (likely specified within the notebook itself)
Pandas (data manipulation)
NumPy (numerical computing)
Scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (data visualization)
Install missing libraries using pip install <library_name> in your terminal.
Steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/IslamNiloy/ML-Approach.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd ML-Approach
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Bash
jupyter notebook
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will launch your Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Open medical_insurance_cost_prediction_cse498r.ipynb to start exploring the code.

Usage
The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the ML approach for medical insurance cost prediction. This likely includes:

Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data
Feature engineering (creating new features from existing ones)
Model selection and training
Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score)
Hyperparameter tuning (optimizing model performance)
Visualization of results
Further Exploration
Experiment with different ML algorithms
Refine feature engineering techniques
Consider additional data sources
Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning
