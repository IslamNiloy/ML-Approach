# A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Medical Insurance Costs

This repository explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict medical insurance costs using a Jupyter Notebook titled `medical_insurance_cost_prediction_cse498r.ipynb`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (likely specified within the notebook itself):
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - NumPy (numerical computing)
  - Scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
  - Matplotlib or Seaborn (data visualization)

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IslamNiloy/ML-Approach.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ML-Approach
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will launch your Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Open `medical_insurance_cost_prediction_cse498r.ipynb` to explore the code.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the ML approach for medical insurance cost prediction. This likely covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data
- Feature engineering (creating new features from existing ones)
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score)
- Hyperparameter tuning (optimizing model performance)
- Visualization of results

## Further Exploration

Consider these areas for further development:

- Experimenting with different ML algorithms
- Refining feature engineering techniques
- Integrating additional data sources
- Improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning
